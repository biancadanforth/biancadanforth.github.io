# Upgrade Lightbeam Blog

Welcome! This is the page I ([Bianca Danforth](http://biancadanforth.com)) will be using as a blog for my [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/) web development internship with [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org) between May and August 2017.

## What I am working on

Re-designing and re-implementing the Firefox add-on [Lightbeam](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/) as a WebExtension. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/pauljt/lightbeam-we).

#### Setting up the blog

First-time blogger, long-time reader of blogs! I know there are many options out there, and eventually, I'll probably distill the contents of this page and put it on my professional website. For now though, GitHub Pages seems like the best choice for this blog, since:
- I already have a GitHub account,
- the project is hosted on GitHub,
- there are style templates,
- and Markdown syntax makes presenting content really easy--even code!

```javascript
function checkSyntaxHighlighting() {
  return true;
}

const isWorking = checkSyntaxHighlighting(); // true
```
