# Upgrade Lightbeam Blog

Welcome! This is the page I ([Bianca Danforth](http://biancadanforth.com)) will be using as a blog for my [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/) web development internship with [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org) between May and August 2017.

## What I am working on

Re-designing and re-implementing the Firefox add-on [Lightbeam](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/) as a WebExtension. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/pauljt/lightbeam-we).
