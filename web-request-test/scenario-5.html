      <h2>Scenario 5: A service worker is used.</h2>
      <p>
        I set up my own service worker and hosted the fake website over HTTPS on my GitHub website.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Request 1</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>response.documentUrl</th>
          <td>biancadanforth.github.io</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>response.originUrl</th>
          <td>biancadanforth.github.io</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>response.targetUrl</th>
          <td>assets-cdn.github.com</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The third party request (to load an image from GitHub) made by the service worker is reported by webRequest.onResponseStarted and captured with the current logic. I have not been able to get a third party resource cached in the Service Worker to test this additional scenario, as I get a COR error.</p>
